# Python Analog and Digital Clock App with Vaporwave-inspired Styling
The Python Analog and Digital Clock App is a graphical application developed using Python's Tkinter library. This application combines the elegance of an analog clock with the simplicity and readability of a digital clock. Inspired by the Vaporwave aesthetic, it features a sleek black, white, and gray color scheme, rounded corners, and a clean, modern design reminiscent of Apple's user interface principles.
Features
1. Analog and Digital Clock

The program displays both analog and digital representations of the current time. The analog clock provides a classic time-telling experience with hour, minute, and second hands. The digital clock showcases the time in a clear, easy-to-read format.
2. Real-time Timekeeping

The clock accurately tracks and displays real-time data, including hours, minutes, seconds, and the current date. It synchronizes with your system's time settings.
3. Seasonal Information

Beneath the clock display, the application shows the current date, including the day, month, year, and the current season. The season is determined based on the month, providing additional context to the user.
4. Vaporwave-inspired Styling

The program's visual aesthetics draw inspiration from the Vaporwave style, incorporating a black background with white and gray elements. The use of rounded corners enhances the overall visual appeal.
5. Installation and Dependencies

To run the Python Analog and Digital Clock App, follow these steps:

  Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

  Install the required libraries using pip, the Python package manager:

`pip install tk ttkthemes pytz`

  tk is the Tkinter library for GUI components.
  ttkthemes is used to apply custom themes to Tkinter widgets.
  pytz handles time zone information.

Download the source code from the GitHub repository: GitHub Repository Link

Execute the Python script:

bash

  `python vaporwave_clock.py`

  The Analog and Digital Clock App window will open, displaying the current time and date in the Vaporwave-inspired style.

How It Works

The program utilizes Python's Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) window. Within this window, it employs the following components:

    Analog Clock: The analog clock is drawn using the Canvas widget. It calculates the positions of clock hands based on the current time and updates them in real-time. The clock face consists of hour markers and numbers for each hour.

    Digital Clock: The digital clock is implemented as a Label widget. It receives real-time updates of the current time, ensuring accuracy and synchronization with the system clock.

    Date and Season Display: Beneath the clocks, labels display the current date and season. The date information is obtained from the system, and the season is determined based on the month.

    Styling: The Vaporwave-inspired styling involves setting the background color to black and using white and gray for foreground elements. The rounded corners are achieved through the application's window manager settings.

    Timekeeping: To keep accurate time, the program uses the pytz library to handle time zones and synchronize with the system's clock.

Conclusion

The Python Analog and Digital Clock App with Vaporwave-inspired Styling provides an elegant and visually appealing way to keep track of time while adding a touch of nostalgia with its Vaporwave aesthetics. Its combination of analog and digital displays, along with seasonal information, makes it a unique and functional addition to your desktop.

To enjoy this stylish clock, follow the installation instructions provided, and you'll have a sleek and functional timekeeping tool right at your fingertips. Whether you're a fan of Vaporwave aesthetics or simply appreciate a well-designed clock, this application is sure to impress.
